- I used this tutorial to create the quantity selection in the product listing (Listing.js). I modified the code to better fit the project and created a class in CSS to manage both buttons and the value field.

- I had some issues connecting the frontend and backend used this tutorial to learn how to connect the backend (created with NodeJS to retrieve data from MongoDB) with the React frontend to display such data. I modified the code to match my database configuration and needs to search/filter data.

- I used this tutorial to create the expandable and collapsible sections for the search filters (Search.js). I modified the code to match the styles and behaviours established in Assignment 1, as well as fixed the auto-resizing issue (i.e., header size is auto-resized when the content is revealed. They should both have the same width now.)
