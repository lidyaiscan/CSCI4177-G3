## Feature Implemented

Favourites

## Description

Implemented the Favourites feature. From a product's listing, you can select "Add to Favourites" in order to add the product to your favourites. On the navbar the user can click on the "Favourites" button to navigate to the Favourites page. Here the user can browse their favourited items and go to their listings. From the listing, the user can also remove the products from their favourites list.
The favourites are stored in the browsers local storage. This means that a user does not need to create an account in order to add products to their favourites list.
